Some thoughts of ideas and things to do for the SDK

* posting out view controller
* posting out api interface
* View of the connected services, maybe as an icon grid
* Cache the last handful of API requests so they can be reused quickly (for example, if the friends picker is pulled up multiple times quickly it has to reload each time).
* friend picker multi select mode
  * check mark accessory
* friend picker delegate
  * event for each pick
* reevaluate session delegate
